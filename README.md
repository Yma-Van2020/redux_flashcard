# Flashcards redux project

In this project, I practiced using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. Users will be able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users will also be able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

## How To Use ðŸ”§

From your command line, first clone Flashcards:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/inarie/Flashcards.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Flashcards

```

Then you can install the dependencies using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```

**NOTE**:
If your run into issues installing the dependencies with NPM, use this command:

```bash
# Install dependencies with all permissions
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` and you will see the website running.
